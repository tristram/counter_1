The aim of this code fragment is to demonstrate what is necessary
to produce a C extension to Ruby.

To make the extension interesting it must have some state, so we
are going to code a counter.  Each call to 'next' should return
the integers in order, starting from 1.

The file test/counter_test.rb contains the tests to drive the
development.
